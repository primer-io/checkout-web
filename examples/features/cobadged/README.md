# Cobadged

In this example we integrate Primer's Web SDK v2 headless with co-badged cards.

It uses [Astro](https://astro.build) as the base tool, but feel free to build your website and server however you'd like.

## Running locally

1. Install [Bun](https://bun.sh)
2. Run `bun install` on a terminal
3. Follow the same instructions described on the section above about the `API_KEY`
4. Execute the following script on a terminal window:
   ```sh
   bun start
   ```
